Optional Intake assignment Avans Hogeschool Breda

**Asignment**

Create an application where you can keep track of performances by bands and artists. A band or artist has a name and a description. A performance is given on a stage and has a start time and an end time. A stage also has a description.
With this application you can see which band or artist has a performance on a stage at what time. You can add, modify and delete bands, artists, stages and performances. All information about the occurrence of a band (or artist) can be seen in one screen.

**Requirements**

*Functional:*
* CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations: you can create, read, modify and delete bands / artists, performances and stages.
* There is a screen where you can see from a band / artist at what time on which stage it will play.
* With a 'next' and 'previous' button you will see the information of the next or previous performance.
* There are separate screens for creating a new band and a new stage or performance.
* A band can have multiple performances, but that only one band is playing during a performance.

*Technical:*
* All source code is in English.
* All classes and methods have a short explanation in comments.
* All tables in the database have a primary key.
* All relations between tables are made via foreign key constructions.
* The database also contains sample data.
* The data types used fit as well as possible with the data used.
* The choice for programming language and database management system are free. A prerequisite for the programming language is that it is object-oriented. If you want to use PHP, or fully and correctly object-oriented. Also note that programming in PHP is not part of the curriculum and languages like Java, C # are.
* You may not use an ORM such as the Entity Framework from Microsoft. You create SQL queries yourself that you explicitly enter in the code.

*Visuals:*
* Make sure that the application has a clean, clear design.

*Not included on the github:*
* There is a design of the information in the form of an ERD.
* There is a design of the database (tables) and this is consistent with the ERD.
* There is a design of the code in the form of a UML class diagram.
